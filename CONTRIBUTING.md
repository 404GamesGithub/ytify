- Since v4 & v5 we have refactored the entire project such that it is highly contributable and understandable.
- To add to our repository, check out our issues. We have a number of features on the way, and tag some issues as "good first issue" to signal that they are good for newcomers.
- To contribute, fork the repository, make a branch, commit your changes, and make a pull request. 
- Considering to fix a bug or add a new feature? Make sure to increment the minor version number in the footer tag of index page if you do so.

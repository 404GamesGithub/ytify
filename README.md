## Description 🦚
ytify, a portmanteau for YouTube & spotIFY, is a minimal audio streaming application which easily captures youtube links 
to provide the user with a stream of audio. ytify allows users to listen without worrying about low bandwidth or metered 
data consumption. It also provides a smooth and personalised user experience with features including:

 - Queue: Always have something coming up next. ytify lets you add multiple links to keep your music going. 
 - Playlist Support: Drop the link to a youtube playlist to fill up your queue without having to copy and paste each link. 
 - Colour Picker: ytify’s sleek design uses colours selected from the thumbnail of your youtube link. 

ytify is a web app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to smoothly integrate into your browsing experience. 

Upcoming features include backward and forward seek buttons, performance enhancements, an expanded settings menu, and bitrate selection.
